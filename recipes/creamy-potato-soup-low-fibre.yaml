steps:
  - Heat 2 tablespoons (about 27g) of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
  - Add the onion powder and garlic powder, along with a large pinch of salt and pepper. Stir for about 1-2 minutes to toast the spices and release their aromatics (they will become fragrant but be careful not to burn them).
  - Add the white wine vinegar and cook for approximately 30 seconds, stirring to deglaze any toasted spices from the bottom of the pot.
  - Add the peeled and roughly chopped potatoes and vegetable broth to the pot. Stir to combine.
  - Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and leave to simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are completely tender and easily pierced with a fork.
  - Remove from heat and let cool slightly (about 5 minutes). Transfer the soup mixture to a blender. Add the Dijon mustard, fresh lemon juice, smoked paprika, and the remaining 1 tablespoon (14g) of olive oil. Blend until completely smooth and silky.
  - Taste and season to perfection with additional salt and pepper as needed. If the soup is too thick, add a splash of broth or water to reach desired consistency.
  - Divide the soup between 6 bowls. Top each serving with a dollop (1.5 tbsp) of Greek yoghurt, chopped chives, and shredded cheese.

science_notes:
  - "Heating olive oil at medium temperature releases fruity, peppery flavor compounds without breaking down beneficial polyphenols."
  - "Onion powder and garlic powder are dehydrated aromatics. Toasting them in oil rehydrates flavor compounds and creates depth."
  - "Powdered aromatics lack fresh onion/garlic's enzyme-activated compounds (allicin, thiosulfinates), but still provide savory flavor with minimal fiber."
  - "Vinegar's acetic acid deglazes the pot by dissolving any toasted spice particles, incorporating concentrated flavor back into the soup."
  - "Peeling potatoes removes insoluble fiber in skins, creating ultra-smooth texture when pureed. Lower fiber content is gentler on sensitive digestion."
  - "White potatoes contain 15-17% starch by weight. When heated in liquid, starch granules swell and gelatinize, creating natural creaminess without dairy."
  - "Simmering (180-200°F) gently breaks down cell walls without violent boiling, which can make potatoes waterlogged and bland."
  - "Dijon mustard contains lecithin (from egg yolk), which acts as an emulsifier to keep fat and water molecules suspended together for silky texture."
  - "Lemon juice's citric acid brightens flavors by stimulating taste receptors and balancing the earthy starchiness of potatoes."
  - "Smoked paprika adds depth through compounds created during smoking process (phenols, guaiacol). Color comes from carotenoid pigments."
  - "Blending hot soup creates friction heat that can increase temperature 20-30°F. Always blend carefully and vent steam to prevent eruption."
  - "This low-fiber version (3.3g fiber per serving) is gentler on the digestive system—ideal for post-surgery recovery, ostomy care, or digestive sensitivities."
