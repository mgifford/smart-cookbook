steps:
  - Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
  - In a large bowl, combine the whole garlic cloves, roughly chopped onion, cauliflower florets, and broccoli florets.
  - In a small bowl, add half the olive oil (about 1.5 tbsp / 20g) and mix in the dried parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and sea salt until combined into a spiced oil.
  - Pour the spiced oil over the vegetables and toss until all pieces are well coated.
  - Spread the coated vegetables evenly on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Roast for about 30 minutes, or until very tender and caramelized, flipping halfway through (around 15 minutes).
  - When the vegetables are nearly done roasting (about 25 minutes in), warm the remaining olive oil (1.5 tbsp / 21g) in a large soup pot over medium heat.
  - Add the kale leaves and half of the vegetable broth (2 cups / 473g) to the pot and cover with a lid. Let cook for 2 minutes, or until kale is wilted and tender.
  - When the roasted vegetables are done, add them to the pot with the wilted kale. Pour in the remaining vegetable broth (2 cups / 473g).
  - Bring the soup to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, then remove from heat immediately.
  - Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot until smooth and creamy. Alternatively, carefully transfer the soup in batches to a high-speed blender with the lid vent open (cover with a towel to prevent splattering) and blend until smooth.
  - Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt if needed. Divide into 4 serving bowls and enjoy!

science_notes:
  - "Roasting at 400°F triggers the Maillard reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars, creating hundreds of savory flavor compounds (pyrazines, furans)."
  - "Caramelization of garlic occurs at 300-350°F, converting harsh sulfur compounds into sweet, nutty flavors through enzymatic breakdown."
  - "Whole garlic cloves roasted intact develop mellow sweetness as allicin (pungent compound) breaks down into milder polysulfides."
  - "Olive oil's polyphenols infuse vegetables during roasting, adding fruity, peppery notes. Coating vegetables prevents moisture loss and promotes even browning."
  - "Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower) contain indole-3-carbinol and sulforaphane—compounds with cancer-preventative properties that survive roasting."
  - "Roasting concentrates vegetable sugars through water evaporation, intensifying natural sweetness (especially in onions, cauliflower, broccoli)."
  - "Kale contains lutein and zeaxanthin (carotenoids) that are better absorbed with fat. Wilting kale in oil enhances nutrient bioavailability."
  - "Quick wilting (2 minutes) preserves kale's vitamin C and folate, which degrade with prolonged heat exposure above 180°F."
  - "Dark leafy greens like kale are high in fiber (7g per serving in this recipe), which supports gut health and may reduce cancer risk."
  - "Blending roasted vegetables with greens creates an emulsion—microscopic particles suspended in liquid—resulting in a creamy, velvety texture without dairy."
  - "Garlic and onions contain allium compounds (allicin, diallyl sulfide) that boost immune cells and may help prevent cancer development."
  - "This recipe combines cancer-preventative foods: cruciferous vegetables (sulforaphane), alliums (organosulfur compounds), and dark leafy greens (antioxidants)."
