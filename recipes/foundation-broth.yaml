steps:
  - Remove any visible fat from the meat and cut into small pieces, keeping the bones intact.
  - Place the meat and bones in a large pot and cover with cold water. Let soak for 30 minutes (this draws out impurities and blood, resulting in a clearer broth).
  - After soaking, bring the pot slowly to a boil over medium heat. Skim off any foam or scum that rises to the surface during the first 10 minutes of boiling.
  - Once the soup is boiling, add the washed cereal (sago, rice, or pearl barley). Stir gently to prevent sticking.
  - Reduce heat to low and simmer gently for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The slow simmer extracts collagen and flavor from the bones.
  - Add the finely chopped celery, carrot, and onion to the soup. Continue simmering for another 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the broth is flavorful.
  - Remove the bones from the soup using a slotted spoon or strainer. Discard the bones.
  - Taste and season the broth with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot as a nourishing, easily digestible soup.

science_notes:
  - "Soaking meat and bones in cold water for 30 minutes draws out blood proteins and impurities, resulting in a clearer, cleaner-tasting broth."
  - "Bringing broth to a boil slowly (not rapid boiling) prevents proteins from coagulating too quickly, which would cloud the broth."
  - "Skimming foam (denatured proteins and impurities) from the surface during the first 10 minutes of boiling creates a crystal-clear broth."
  - "Simmering at 180-200°F extracts collagen from bones and connective tissue. Collagen breaks down into gelatin, which gives broth body and richness."
  - "Bones release minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium) into the broth during long simmering, creating a nutrient-dense liquid."
  - "Cereal starches (rice, barley, sago) gelatinize when heated in liquid, absorbing water and thickening the broth while adding texture."
  - "Mirepoix vegetables (celery, carrot, onion) are the classic aromatic base. Their sugars caramelize slightly during simmering, adding depth."
  - "Onions contain sulfur compounds that break down into sweet, savory molecules during cooking, balancing the broth's flavor."
  - "Carrots add natural sweetness through sugars and beta-carotene (which also gives the broth a warm, golden color)."
  - "Celery contains glutamic acid (a natural source of umami), which enhances the savory depth of the broth."
  - "This foundation broth is easily digestible and ideal for people recovering from illness, surgery, or cancer treatment—providing protein, minerals, and gentle calories."
  - "Removing bones before serving prevents choking hazards and makes the soup easier to consume for those with swallowing difficulties."
