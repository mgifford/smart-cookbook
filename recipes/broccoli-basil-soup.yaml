steps:
  - Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add the chopped onion, potato, and celery. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and the onion is translucent.
  - Add the roughly chopped broccoli (including stems), diced garlic, vegetable stock, and boiling water. Stir to combine.
  - Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the broccoli and all vegetables are cooked through and tender.
  - Stir through most of the fresh basil (including stalks), saving a few leaves to garnish. The heat will wilt the basil and release its aromatic oils.
  - Remove from heat and let cool slightly (about 5 minutes). Blend the soup using an immersion blender directly in the pot, or carefully transfer in batches to a regular blender and blend until smooth.
  - Return the soup to the pan to reheat if necessary. Taste and season with freshly ground black pepper to taste.
  - Divide between 4 bowls and garnish with the remaining fresh basil leaves before serving. Serve with toasted baguette rubbed with a garlic clove for a healthy spin on garlic bread.

science_notes:
  - "Sautéing vegetables at medium heat activates enzymes that break down cell walls, concentrating flavors through caramelization without browning."
  - "Celery contains 3-n-butylphthalide, an aromatic compound that gives it distinctive flavor and may help lower blood pressure."
  - "Broccoli contains sulforaphane, a potent antioxidant formed when the enzyme myrosinase (released by chopping) contacts glucoraphanin. Both cooking and blending preserve this compound."
  - "Garlic's allicin is formed when crushing/chopping releases enzyme alliinase. Adding garlic late prevents it from burning (which creates bitterness)."
  - "Potato starch (amylose and amylopectin) gelatinizes when heated in liquid, swelling to create natural creaminess when pureed without dairy."
  - "Simmering at 180-200°F gently breaks down vegetable cell walls without aggressive boiling that can leach nutrients into cooking water."
  - "Fresh basil contains volatile oils (linalool, eugenol) that provide sweet, peppery flavor. Blending basil releases these oils, infusing the soup."
  - "Basil stalks contain concentrated flavor compounds and nutrients. Using the whole plant reduces waste and maximizes taste."
  - "Blending hot soup creates an emulsion—tiny vegetable particles suspended in liquid—that feels rich and creamy even with minimal fat."
  - "Black pepper contains piperine, which enhances nutrient absorption (especially from cruciferous vegetables) and adds mild heat without masking other flavors."
  - "This soup freezes well because the emulsified structure remains stable when thawed. Cruciferous vegetables retain nutrients even after freezing."
