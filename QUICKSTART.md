## Common Questions

### Q: Do I have to credit sources?
**Legally:** No (ingredient lists aren't copyrighted)
**Ethically:** Yes, please (it builds community)
**Practically:** Absolutely (for online, it helps you too)

### Q: Can I sell a cookbook using these recipes?
**Yes!** With attribution and CC BY-SA license.
Your profit comes from:
- Your photos
- Your writing
- Your brand
- Your design
- Not from "owning" the recipes

### Q: What if I improve a recipe?
**Please share it!** Post:
- A comment on the blog
- A pull request on GitHub
- Your own blog post (with credit)
- A recipe forum

**You get credit. Community benefits. Win-win.**

### Q: Can I keep my version secret?
**Not if you use these recipes as a base.** CC BY-SA requires sharing improvements. 

If you want privacy:
- Develop entirely original recipes
- Keep them as trade secrets
- Don't base them on CC BY-SA recipes

### Q: This seems risky—what if people copy me?
**They can copy the recipe, but they can't copy:**
- Your photos
- Your voice
- Your brand
- Your reputation
- Your community loyalty

**Fact:** Your brand is worth infinitely more than restricting a recipe.

Automatically copyrighted
(People follow YOU, not just the recipe)
```

### Layer 3: Your Brand (Most Valuable)
```
Your reputation, consistency, community trust

Worth more than any legal restriction
```

### Layer 4: Your Business (Thrives on Openness)
```
Books, courses, products, consulting

## The Philosophy (Tl;Dr)

**Traditional view:**
> "This is MY recipe. Don't use it."

**Open view:**
> "Here's MY recipe, use it! If you improve it, share it back!"

**Why it works:**
- Recipes were always meant to be shared
- Your value is your voice, not your ingredients
- Community improves recipes faster than individuals
- Open culture builds loyal audiences
- Best recipes win through quality, not restriction
