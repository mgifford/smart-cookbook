steps:
  - Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the diced vegetables and fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften and develop some color.
  - Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well for 1-2 minutes. This creates a roux that will thicken the soup and prevent lumps.
  - Crumble the chicken stock cubes into the pan, then add the water, tomato paste, and drained butter beans. Stir to combine, making sure the flour is fully incorporated.
  - Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are completely tender.
  - Remove from heat and let cool slightly (about 5 minutes). Blend the soup in a blender or food processor until smooth. Work in batches if necessary, filling the blender only halfway.
  - Return the pureed soup to the saucepan. Add the milk, cream, and uncooked rice. Stir to combine.
  - Bring back to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and fully cooked.
  - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot.

science_notes:
  - "Sautéing vegetables in oil before adding liquid develops flavor through the Maillard reaction (browning of proteins and sugars)."
  - "Flour cooked in fat creates a roux—the foundation for thickened soups and sauces. Cooking flour removes raw, starchy taste."
  - "Stirring flour into hot oil coats the starch granules with fat, preventing clumping when liquid is added."
  - "Stock cubes are concentrated flavor (hydrolyzed proteins, yeast extract, salt). They dissolve and distribute umami throughout the soup."
  - "Tomato paste is concentrated tomato solids (about 30% vs 5% in fresh tomatoes). Cooking it caramelizes sugars and deepens flavor."
  - "Butter beans (lima beans) are 20% starch by weight. When pureed, they create natural creaminess and body without dairy."
  - "Simmering vegetables for 30 minutes breaks down cell walls and releases pectin, which adds body and helps thicken the soup."
  - "Blending soup creates an emulsion of starch, protein, and fat suspended in liquid—resulting in a creamy texture even before adding dairy."
  - "Rice added after blending absorbs liquid and releases starch granules, further thickening the soup and adding texture."
  - "Milk and cream add richness and round out flavors. Their fat molecules coat the palate, creating a luxurious mouthfeel."
  - "This soup is nutrient-dense and easily digestible—ideal for people recovering from illness or undergoing cancer treatment who need gentle, nourishing calories."
  - "Butter beans provide plant-based protein (7g per cup) and fiber, supporting gut health and satiety."
