## 🔑 Core Messages

### Message 1: Recipes Are Free
> "Ingredient lists are facts. Facts aren't copyrighted. This is intentional and good."

**Why:** Cooking evolves through sharing. Restricting recipes stifles innovation.

### Message 2: Your Voice Is Protected
> "You can't copyright ingredients, but you CAN copyright your photos, stories, and descriptions."

**Why:** Your brand is what people follow, not your ingredient list.

### Message 3: Remix Is Culture
> "Like open-source software, recipes improve when shared, adapted, and remixed."

**Why:** The best recipes come from iteration and community improvement.

### Message 4: Attribution Builds Community
> "Credit sources—not for legal reasons, but because it's respectful and builds trust."

**Why:** Open culture thrives on giving credit where it's due.

### Message 5: Open Drives Business
> "Build your career on quality and brand, not on locking up recipes."

**Why:** Sustainable food businesses profit from reputation and service, not secrecy.

## 💡 The Philosophy in a Nutshell

```
Old Model               →    New Model
──────────────────           ──────────────────
Gatekeep recipes            Share recipes
Restrict use                Encourage remix
Protect ingredients         Protect voice
Fear copying                Welcome adaptation
Secret = valuable           Brand = valuable
Recipes die                 Recipes evolve
Solo innovation             Community innovation
```

**Both** models can be profitable, but the new model is:
- More aligned with how cooking actually works
- Supported by copyright law
- Better for the community
- More sustainable long-term
