steps:
  - Heat olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat. If using ground turkey or chicken, add it now and cook until no longer pink, breaking it into small pieces with a wooden spoon (about 5-7 minutes). Remove cooked meat and set aside.
  - Add carrots, potato, zucchini (if using), and celery (if using) to the pot. Sauté for 3-4 minutes to soften slightly and develop flavor.
  - Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until all vegetables are very tender and easily pierced with a fork.
  - If you used ground turkey or chicken, return it to the pot. Add the dried thyme or parsley (if using) and salt to taste.
  - Remove from heat and let cool slightly (about 5 minutes). Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until completely smooth. Alternatively, carefully transfer in batches to a regular blender and blend until smooth, then return to the pot.
  - Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. If the soup is too thick, add more broth or water to reach desired consistency. Reheat gently if needed before serving.

science_notes:
  - "Browning ground meat (Maillard reaction) creates savory flavor compounds. Breaking meat into small pieces increases surface area for browning and makes blending easier."
  - "Sautéing vegetables before adding liquid activates enzymes and begins breaking down cell walls, which concentrates flavors and reduces cooking time."
  - "Simmering (180-200°F) gently breaks down vegetable cell walls and gelatinizes potato starch, which thickens the soup naturally when pureed."
  - "Potatoes contain amylose and amylopectin starches that swell when heated in liquid, creating a creamy texture when blended without needing cream."
  - "Pureeing vegetables creates an emulsion—tiny particles suspended in liquid—that feels smooth and rich on the palate even with minimal fat."
  - "Peeling vegetables removes insoluble fiber and bitter compounds in skins, creating a smoother, milder flavor profile suitable for sensitive digestion."
  - "Salt enhances flavor by suppressing bitterness and enhancing sweet/savory notes. Add after cooking to maintain control over sodium levels, especially with low-sodium broth."
  - "Cooling soup slightly before blending reduces steam pressure and prevents hot liquid from erupting. Always blend hot liquids carefully or in small batches."
