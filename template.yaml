    Use whole units for ingredients commonly bought/measured that way (eggs, 
    bananas, etc.). See conversions.yaml for qty_g reference. Always include 
    qty_g for scaling math; vol_est is for kitchen intuition.

steps:
  - Preheat oven to 180C.
  - Mix dry ingredients.
  - Fold in wet ingredients and bake 25 min.
science_notes:
  - Flour provides gluten structure that traps gas bubbles from leavening
  - Butter adds fat which tenderizes by coating gluten strands
  - Baking at 180C triggers Maillard reaction for browning and flavor
