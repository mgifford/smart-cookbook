      - name: Greek yoghurt
        ratio: 1.0
        science_note: "Tangy, high protein; adds creaminess without heavy fat. Stir in off heat to prevent curdling."

steps:
  - Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent but not browned.
  - Add the cumin seeds to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. The cumin will become fragrant and toasted—this releases its essential oils and deepens the flavor.
  - Add the chopped potatoes and stock to the pan. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil over high heat.
  - Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are completely tender and easily pierced with a fork.
  - Remove from heat and let cool slightly (about 5 minutes). Puree the soup in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Work in batches if necessary, filling the blender only halfway to prevent hot liquid from erupting.
  - Return the pureed soup to the saucepan. Stir in the cream and heat gently over low heat until warmed through (do not boil after adding cream, as it may separate).
  - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs or a swirl of cream if desired.

science_notes:
  - "Heating oil before adding leeks creates a barrier that prevents moisture loss, allowing leeks to soften without browning (sweating technique)."
  - "Leeks contain fructans (a type of carbohydrate) that break down during cooking, releasing natural sweetness and creating a mild, delicate onion flavor."
  - "Toasting cumin seeds in hot oil activates volatile compounds (cuminaldehyde, pinene) that create warm, earthy, slightly citrus-like aromas."
  - "Whole cumin seeds release flavor more slowly than ground cumin, providing a subtle, layered taste throughout the soup."
  - "Potatoes contain 15-17% starch (amylose and amylopectin). When heated in liquid, starch granules swell and gelatinize, creating natural creaminess."
  - "Simmering at 180-200°F gently breaks down potato cell walls without violent boiling, which can make potatoes waterlogged and bland."
  - "Pureeing soup creates an emulsion—microscopic starch and vegetable particles suspended in liquid—that feels rich and velvety even before cream is added."
  - "Cream contains 35-40% fat. Fat molecules coat the tongue, creating a luxurious mouthfeel and carrying fat-soluble flavors (like cumin's essential oils)."
  - "Adding cream off-heat or on very low heat prevents curdling. High heat can cause cream proteins to coagulate and separate from the liquid."
  - "This soup provides comfort and easy-to-digest calories, ideal for people recovering from illness or undergoing cancer treatment."
  - "Leeks are milder than onions, making them easier on sensitive digestive systems while still providing aromatic depth."
