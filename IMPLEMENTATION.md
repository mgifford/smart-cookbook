## 🎯 Three Audiences & Their Paths

### 1. Home Cook
```
What: Just wants to cook
Path: index.html → Try recipe → Cook
Copyright awareness: Low (no need for it!)
```

### 2. Food Blogger
```
What: Wants to publish recipes online
Path: QUICKSTART.md → Pick recipe → Create photos → Rewrite → Post with credit
Copyright awareness: Medium (understand attribution, fair use)
Example: "Adapted from The Science Cookbook, with my own spice tweaks"
```

### 3. Cookbook Author / Food Business
```
What: Publishing or commercializing recipes
Path: PHILOSOPHY.md → COPYRIGHT.md → LICENSE.md → Plan strategy
Copyright awareness: High (understand licensing, attribution, commercial use)
Example: Write cookbook with CC BY-SA 4.0, include attribution, share improvements
```

## 📊 Copyright Concept Map

```
Recipes
├── Ingredient Lists
│   ├── Status: NOT copyrighted (facts)
│   ├── Use: Free to use
│   └── You can: Adapt, share, commercialize
├── Basic Instructions
│   ├── Status: NOT copyrighted (functional)
│   ├── Use: Free to use
│   └── You can: Adapt, teach, share
└── Your Expression (PROTECTED)
    ├── Photos
    │   ├── Status: COPYRIGHTED (original work)
    │   ├── Use: Your permission required
    │   └── You own: All rights
    ├── Stories & Voice

## 🎁 How CC BY-SA 4.0 Works

### The Cycle
```
Recipe shared (CC BY-SA)
      ↓
User adapts it
      ↓
User publishes adaptation
      ↓
MUST: Share under CC BY-SA
MUST: Credit original
      ↓
Others can remix that adaptation
      ↓
Community improves recipes together
```

### What This Means
- ✅ Ingredient lists stay free forever
- ✅ Your improvements benefit everyone
- ✅ Original creator gets credit
- ✅ Knowledge doesn't get locked up
- ✅ Recipes evolve continuously

---

## 💡 The Core Insight

### Traditional View
```
Chef: "This is MY recipe!"
↓
Can't share (lost revenue)
Can't adapt (legal risk)
Innovation stops
```

### Open View
```
Chef: "Here's my recipe + science notes!"
↓
Community uses it
Someone improves it
Improvements come back
Everyone learns
Original chef gets credit + reputation
```

**The trick:** Your reputation is worth more than restricting ingredients.
