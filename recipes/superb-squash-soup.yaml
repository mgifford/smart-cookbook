steps:
  - Trim and thinly slice the leeks (white and light green parts only), then rinse well to remove any grit. Peel and finely chop the carrots and garlic, then trim and finely chop the celery.
  - Heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the sage leaves and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp, then remove to kitchen paper and set aside.
  - Place the pan of flavoured oil back on the heat, add the leeks, carrots, garlic, celery and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then cook gently for 10 minutes, or until sweet and soft.
  - Meanwhile, halve the squash, deseed it, and roughly chop it into chunks (no need to peel if using butternut squash—the skin becomes tender when cooked and adds nutrients). When the vegetables are soft and fragrant, add the squash and stock to the pan.
  - Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the squash is completely tender and falling apart.
  - While the soup simmers, prepare the croutons. Drizzle a little olive oil over each slice of ciabatta and pat it in. Finely grate Parmesan cheese and press it onto both sides of each slice. Place in a dry, non-stick pan over medium heat and fry until golden and crispy on both sides (about 2-3 minutes per side).
  - When the squash is tender, remove from heat and let cool slightly. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth and creamy—or leave it slightly chunky if you prefer more texture. Alternatively, carefully transfer in batches to a regular blender.
  - Taste and season to perfection with additional salt and pepper as needed. If the soup is too thick, add a splash of stock or water to reach your desired consistency.
  - Divide the soup between 8 bowls. Place 2 Parmesan croutons on top of each serving, sprinkle with a few crispy sage leaves, and drizzle with a swirl of quality extra virgin olive oil before serving.

science_notes:
  - "Frying sage in oil infuses the fat with volatile aromatic compounds (thujone, camphor). Crispy leaves form as water evaporates and leaf structure collapses."
  - "Leeks are milder than onions, containing similar sulfur compounds but in lower concentrations. They add delicate sweetness without pungency."
  - "Sweating aromatics (leeks, carrots, celery, garlic) at medium heat releases enzymes that break down cell walls, concentrating flavors without browning."
  - "Leeks' fructans (long-chain sugars) break down during cooking, releasing natural sweetness that balances the earthiness of squash."
  - "Squash skin contains nutrients and fiber; when simmered, pectin breaks down and skin becomes tender enough to puree smoothly."
  - "Simmering (180-200°F) gelatinizes squash starch, creating creamy texture without dairy. Beta-carotene gives vibrant orange color."
  - "Parmesan browns when heated due to Maillard reaction between milk proteins and residual sugars. Creates nutty, savory crust."
  - "Pressing cheese onto bread creates adhesion—moisture from cheese acts as glue. Heat melts cheese and toasts bread simultaneously."
  - "Blending hot soup creates an emulsion—tiny particles suspended in liquid—that feels rich and velvety even without cream."
  - "Finishing with raw extra virgin olive oil preserves delicate polyphenols and fruity notes that would be destroyed by heat."
